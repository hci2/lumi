## Description

For people living or working in mountainous areas avalanches possessa considerable threat during the whole winter time. Therefore, having fastand reliable access to accurate information about the current avalanchesituation and alert level can be essential. Unfortunately, current avail-able apps only provide limited information, as they usually display oneavalanche alert level for a whole region without distinguishing betweensingle slopes with different properties. To improve this situation, I havefocused on this issue and I want to demonstrate that it can be solved. Incollaboration with researchers of the Research Center of Forests of Tyrol,I created a high fidelity prototype named Lumi that fulfills exactly thisneed. The app development followed the user centered design approach[2]. The main challenge and reason why this hasn’t been solved before, isthat the avalanche data providers don’t provide detailed local avalancherelated information. To solve this problem, I created slope area modelsand assigned them properties. Furthermore, I created a model that ex-tracts and filters the currently available data and searches for matcheswith the properties of slope area models. Due to this method, it is nowpossible to provide slope specific avalanche bulletins via the mobile appLumi for a small area in Tyrol for three specific days.

It was realized as a bachelor thesis in the bachlor university.

It is based on Android, Java and is combined with an open source Map and GIS data for layering.
